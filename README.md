# Polymer IE9 Demo

## What this repo contains:
A Polymer demo with polyfills for FormData, classList and matchMedia.

## What's known to be broken:
1. CSS Flexbox: the modern version has no polyfill, so layout doesn't work.

## Instructions:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `bower install`
3. Serve index.html to IE9 (or any newer browser).
4. Success!
